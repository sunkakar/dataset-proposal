# DATASETS:

## 1. Olympics Data 
* Documentation: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/olympic-data?select=dataset_olympics.csv
* Justification for use: This dataset has ~70,000 rows with data starting from 1896. Well documented and maintained.
* Example Inferences:
  * More women participation can be observed in the Olympics over the years
  * The average age of a athletes has reduced over the years
  * Growth in countries' GDPs is correlated to their number of medals won (Will need secondary data such as GDP index for coutnries through the years)
  * The Olympics has a correlation between winners and location (for ex: more chinese winners at he Beijing Olympics)


## 2. Art History
* Documentation: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-17/readme.md
* Justification for use: Dataset found in TidyTuesday, a weekly 'Rfordatascience' challenge Github repository containing tidy data. Datasource: https://github.com/saralemus7/arthistory. The data was collected to assess the demographic representation of artists through editions of Janson's History of Art and Gardner's Art Through the Ages, two of the most popular art history textbooks used in the American education system.
* Example Inferences:
  * Information listed on artists has been reduced in newer book editions. 
  * MoMA exhibitions for Artists increase as the art gets older.
  * More racially diverse artists were included in the literature over the years.

  
## Student Note: 
Hi Professor, I looked through the provided built-in datasets in R and found them to be small in size. I would like to work with an intermediate to advanced-level dataset (~100K rows) since 
I have a background in Computer Science and R. I would prefer the Olympics dataset and indifferent about the Art History dataset. Thus, I am very open to working with a dataset of your suggestion.
Thanks!
